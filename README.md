# AdvancedAppArchitecture

 AdvancedAppArchitecture is based on [LukohSplash](https://github.com/Lukoh/LukohSplash) & Android latest architectural components,Jetpack, and follows MVVM design pattern. Also AdvancedAppArchitecture App Architecture consist of Presentation layer, Domain layer and Repository layer. And new latest technologies were applied into AdvancedAppArchitecture App as Advanced Android App Architecture. The many advanced functions already were applied into LukohSplahs App. These stuff make Android Apps to be extended being more competitive power and help them to maintain consistency. And I'm also applying Kotlin Language into all modules in AdvancedAppArchitecture and almost codes are written with Kotlin. I'd like to help someone who are trying to learn Kotlin Language to apply Kotlin Language into their project.

I was confident that I could develop high performance apps using Android architecture components and Kotlin Coroutine and Flow without using LiveData and RxJava, RxKotlin about a couple of months ago. And I proved it.

Here are the effective ways to focus on your business logic & simplify modules & reduce the boiler-plate code & using the Module-Pattern(Called Module Pattern by Lukoh). A well-designed/implemented Mobile App using Module-Pattern(that is, well-designed App Architecture) can be extended to new apps faster and easier by applying/adapting new UI layouts and business logic. It helps you focus your business logic and create better services, and you can quickly deliver user-friendly features to your users.

Please refer to [LukohSplash](https://github.com/Lukoh/LukohSplash) & [Better Android Apps Using latest advanced Architecture](https://medium.com/oheadline/better-android-apps-using-mvvm-with-clean-architecture-2cc49e68f41d) & [How to focus effective business logic & implement more expandable & simplify modules & reduce the boiler-plate code using the Module-Pattern to make Android App.](https://medium.com/@lukohnam/how-to-focus-effective-business-logic-implement-more-expandable-simplify-modules-reduce-the-81ae1af23e4e)

Please refer to [How to share/communicate events (independent data) across app components such as Activities, Fragments, Services, etc using ViewModel & SharedFlow.](https://medium.com/@lukohnam/how-to-share-communicate-events-independent-data-across-app-components-such-as-activities-353c96e32775)

Typically, the UI layer contains UI-related state and UI business logic. UI business logic is what gives your app value and the role of the UI is to display the application data on the screen and also to serve as the primary point of user interaction. Separating UI business logic from UI simplifies relationships and allows business logic to be reproduced outside of the UI for unit-testing.

Please refer to [How to handle your internal business logic using ViewModel and UseCase to decouple the logic from UI module.](https://medium.com/@lukohnam/how-to-handle-your-internal-business-logic-using-viewmodel-and-usecase-to-decouple-the-logic-from-f20ee9f7e4a5)

Now letâ€™s dive into my open-source project, AdvancedAppArchitecture, which is based on LukohSplash & the Android MVVM with Clean Architecture and the latest libraries like Jetpack.
And I'm learning Jetpack Compose and will apply it to AdvancedAppArchitecture.

Please get in touch with me via email if you're interested in my technical experience and all techs which are applied into AdvancedAppArchitecture.
